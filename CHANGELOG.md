## [1.4.0-ext.1] — 2026-08-21

### Security (backports from upstream PR #22)

- **Patch B**: sanitize `source` slug with `slugify()` and replace all
  `execSync` shell-string calls for `launchctl` / `systemctl` / `schtasks`
  with `execFileSync` + argument array. Closes command-injection vector
  via `schedule_job`'s `source` parameter.
  Authored upstream by Jason Gaddis, MIT-licensed, cherry-picked at
  commit `e030efa92db56f800b3367a0945d3413bba66e64`.
  Regression tests: `test/security.test.ts` (8 cases).

### Fixed

- **Patch A**: `installSystemdJob` `daemon-reload` / `enable` / `start` now
  pass `{ stdio: "ignore" }` so `systemctl --user enable` no longer leaks
  `Created symlink ...` stdout into the opencode agent TUI.
  Regression tests: `test/install-systemd.test.ts` (4 cases).

### Added

- **Feature C**: TUI notifications when a scheduled run completes.
  - `run_job` (foreground): toast appears in the active TUI on completion.
  - Cron fallback (`supervisor.pl`): same toast via `curl POST /tui/show-toast`
    after `waitpid`, so background runs notify too.
  - `chat.message` hook: auto-injects the run summary into the most recent
    chat session via `client.session.prompt({ noReply: true })`.
- Test suite (`bun test`) with 16 regression tests covering Patch A & B.
- `SECURITY.md` documenting the threat model and fix history.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running `bun install` + `bun test` on every push.
- Source maps in the build (`--sourcemap=external`).

### Changed

- Package renamed `opencode-scheduler` → `opencode-scheduler-ext`.
- Build now emits `dist/index.js.map` alongside the bundle.
- Repository metadata points at the fork owner.
